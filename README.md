# mcp-server-esignatures MCP server

MCP server for eSignatures (https://esignatures.com)

## Tools

These tools are designed to make managing contracts and templates straightforward, ensuring that everything from creation to finalization is smooth and customizable to your needs.

### For Contract Management:

- **Create Contract**: Create a draft contract for review, or send it instantly. You can choose templates or dynamic content, customize emails, set expiration dates, and more.
- **Query Contract**: Look up any contract by its unique ID to check its status or details.
- **Withdraw Contract**: If you've sent out a contract but haven't received signatures yet, you can pull it back with this tool.
- **Delete Contract**: Remove a contract from the system when it's no longer needed.
- **List Recent Contracts**: Get an overview of the recent contracts you've created or managed.

### For Template Management:

- **Create Template**: Create reusable contract templates with Placeholder fields for dynamic content. This makes setting up new contracts much faster.
- **Query Template**: Fetch details of any template you've made, handy for updates or reference.
- **Update Template**: Modify an existing template if you need to change future contracts based on it.
- **Delete Template**: Delete templates that are no longer in use or relevant.
- **List Templates**: List the templates you have in eSignatures.
- **Add/Remove/List Collaborators**: Invite persons to edit a template.
